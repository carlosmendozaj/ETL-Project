Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.\n",

      "Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we’ll take a look at the superior stonk‘s current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‘s fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF’s GF’s ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.\n",
      "\n",
      "MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the most important factor to 🐻 in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.\n",

      "GME stock's most recent quarterly report didn't inspire much confidence, either. The company reported 5.5% higher fourth-quarter profit of $1.34 a share. That missed forecasts by nearly 6%. Meanwhile, revenue sank 3% during the quarter to $2.1 billion. The top line fell short of estimates by 5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it's not just a case of a tough quarter. The company's EPS growth rate started declining consistently in 2017 and turned into outright losses for fiscal 2021, which ended in January. Meanwhile, GME stock's sales posted an 18% annualized drop in the past three years.\n",

      "tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.\n",

It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders.

      "***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.\"***\n",

You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.\n",
