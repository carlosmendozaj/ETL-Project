## Overview/abstract: 

WallStreetBets (r/wallstreetbets, also known as WSB), is a subreddit where participants discuss stock and option trading. This subreddit recently came into visibility given the influence this subreddit had in stock prices. 

We wanted to discover if the volume of posts mentioning specific stocks directly impacted the fluctuation these stocks had each day. To do this, we necessarily had to migrate raw data into a production database, use an API to extract the closing and opening prices for the stocks we wanted to analyze and correlate them with the number of mentions that particular stock had each day.
